# Flight-status-and-notification_airline_reservtion_sytem
 Develop a system to provide real-time flight status updates and notifications to passengers.
 Project Description:
The Flight Status and Notifications System is designed to provide real-time updates and notifications to passengers regarding their flights. The system integrates with airport databases to fetch accurate flight information and uses various notification channels to keep passengers informed about any changes in their flight status, including delays, cancellations, and gate changes.

Summary of the Project:
The project is structured into two main components: the frontend and the backend. The frontend is developed using React.js to create an intuitive and responsive user interface. The backend consists of microservices developed in Python, Go, and Java, which handle flight data processing, notifications, and integration with airport systems. The system uses MongoDB and PostgreSQL for data storage and Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Firebase Cloud Messaging for sending notifications.

### Backend (Booking Microservice)
The backend microservice is responsible for handling flight booking and status updates. It is built using Python (Flask/Django), Go, and Java, and interacts with MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases.

### Frontend
The frontend is developed using React.js, providing a responsive and intuitive interface for users to check flight statuses and receive notifications.

### Notifications
The system uses Firebase Cloud Messaging, Kafka, and RabbitMQ to send push notifications to users about flight status changes.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-status-notifications.git
